# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Projects

1. [Naive Bayes Algorithm for Spam Detection (tutorial)][1]
    * Bag of words model, naive Bayes classifier, model evaluation
2. [Introduction to Decision Trees using the Titanic Survival Data][2]
    * Basic implementation of decision trees
3. [Model Evaluation and Validation using Boston Housing Prices Data][3]
    * Decision trees, performance metrics, learning and complexity curves, bias-variance trade-off, grid search for hyperparameter optimization, cross validation
4. [Supervised Learning to Find Charity Donors][4]
    * Used AdaBoost with the decision trees as the base estimator to predict income levels using various demographic data as features. The goal is to predict which individuals earned more than \$50,000 and are more likely to make a charitable donation
    * Tested logistic regression and SVM models to compare performance
    * Tuned model hyperparameters using grid search
    * Accounted for unbalanced classification in performance metric (with emphasis on precision)
